# advent_of_code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I am currently working my way through the 2020 puzzles in python. I would love to go back and tackle these in R afterwards.
